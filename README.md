Smart Cap For Visually Impaired

Visually Impairment is a situation where a person has sight problem that cannot be rectified by use of glasses or contact lenses.
Hence a wearable smart system is developed to help visually impaired persons walk by themselves through the streets and navigate in public places. The main components of the system are a microcontroller board, various sensors, and vibrating discs. The system employs a set of sensors to track the path and alert the user of obstacles in front of them. The user is alerted by vibrations, which is also helpful when the user has hearing loss or is in a noisy environment.

The system prototype tested and verified its functionality and effectiveness. The proposed system has more features than other similar systems. It is expected to be a useful tool to improve the quality of life of visually impaired people.
